    "**Workflow 1: Get Equity (Stock) Price**\n",

    "3.  Extract the equity symbol (e.g., \"NSE:RELIANCE-EQ\") from the results.\n",
    "4.  Use `get_current_prices` with the found symbol(s) to get the LTP.\n",
    "5.  Report the full company name, symbol, and price.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflow 2: Get Futures Price**\n",
    "1.  User asks for a futures price (e.g., \"TCS futures price?\").\n",
    "2.  Use `search_for_fno_symbol` with the company name (e.g., \"TCS\").\n",
    "3.  This tool will return matches like \"TCS 28OCT2025 FUT,NSE:TCS25OCTFUT\". Pick the most relevant one, usually the nearest expiry.\n",
    "4.  Use `get_current_prices` with the found futures symbol (e.g., [\"NSE:TCS25OCTFUT\"]) to get its LTP.\n",

    "3.  NEXT, use `get_available_expiries` with the underlying symbol (\"NSE:TCS-EQ\").\n",
    "4.  This will return a list of expiry dates (e.g., [date: '28-10-2025', expiry: '1761645600', ...]).\n",

    "6.  **If the user asked for options data (e.g., \"TCS options\"):**\n",
    "    a.  Present the list of available expiry dates and ASK the user which one they want.\n",
    "    b.  If the user doesn't specify, **default to the FIRST expiry** in the list.\n",
    "    c.  Get the 'expiry' timestamp (e.g., \"1761645600\") for the chosen date.\n",
    "    d.  Call `get_option_chain_data` with the underlying symbol (\"NSE:TCS-EQ\") and the chosen timestamp (\"1761645600\").\n",
    "    e.  This returns a spot price and a LONG list of options.\n",
    "    f.  Report the spot price and a *summary* of the options. For example: \"The spot price is 2962.2. I found 200 options for the 28-10-2025 expiry. Strikes near the spot price include...\" DO NOT print the full list unless asked.\n",
